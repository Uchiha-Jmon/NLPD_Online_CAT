as the aid cock crows, the young one learns
 as the bell chinks, so the fool thinks
 as the crow, so the eggs shall be
 as the good man saith, so say we; as the good woman saith, so must it be
 as the twig`s bent, the tree`s inclined
as you sow so shall you reap
 as your wedding ring wears so do your cares
ask about it and you will learn
ask much to get little
ask my companion if i be a thief
ask of god and not of the rich
ask thy purse what thou shouldst buy
